## Partial Application and Currying

### Currying

Consider a type signature of a function with three arguments:

~~~haskell
    f :: X -> Y -> Z -> A
~~~

The arrow "->" is right-associative, so this is the same as:

~~~haskell
    f :: X -> (Y -> (Z -> A))
~~~

What this means is that we can consider `f` as a function with a single argument of type `X` which returns a function of type `Y->Z->A`.

The technique of rewriting a function of multiple arguments into a sequence of functions with a single argument is called _currying_. We can illustrate this best using a lambda function:

~~~haskell
    \x y z -> ...
    \x -> (\y z -> ...)
    \x -> (\y -> (\z -> ... ))  
~~~    

The name "currying", is a reference to logician Haskell Curry. The concept was actually proposed originally by another logician, Moses Sch√∂nfinkel, but his name was not so catchy.

### Partial application 

Partial application means that we don't need to provide all arguments to a function. For example, given <!-- ' -->

~~~haskell
    sq x y = x*x+y*y
~~~

We note that function application associates to the left, so the following equivalence holds

~~~haskell
    sq x y = (sq x) y
~~~

We can therefore create a specialised function by partial application of x:

~~~haskell
    sq4 = sq 4 -- = \y -> 16+y*y
    sq4 3 -- = (sq 4) 3 = sq 4 3 = 25
~~~

This is why you can write things like:

~~~haskell
    doubles = map (*2) [1 .. ]
~~~

<!-- *) -->
