00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:22.990 align:middle line:84%
WIM VANDERBAUWHEDE: Hi and
welcome to our Functional

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.808 align:middle line:90%
Programming in Haskell course.

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:90%
My name is Wim.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:90%
JEREMY SINGER: And I'm Jeremy.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.781 align:middle line:84%
WIM VANDERBAUWHEDE: We want
to supercharge your coding.

00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:32.920 align:middle line:84%
We will help you to be more
effective by making you think

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:90%
about programming in a new way.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:84%
JEREMY SINGER: We are from
the University of Glasgow,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.560 align:middle line:84%
which was a prominent
research contributor

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.904 align:middle line:84%
to the development of the
Haskell programming language.

00:00:42.904 --> 00:00:45.070 align:middle line:84%
WIM VANDERBAUWHEDE: Admittedly,
that was a long time

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:90%
ago in the late eighties.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
JEREMY SINGER: When
we were only students.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:84%
WIM VANDERBAUWHEDE: But
Haskell has grown enormously

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.010 align:middle line:90%
in popularity.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
If you check the online
programming chart,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Haskell is consistently
in the top 50,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.903 align:middle line:84%
and it's a cool topic
of geek conversation.

00:00:59.903 --> 00:01:02.184 align:middle line:84%
If you know Haskell, people
will give you respect.

00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:90%
They might even give you a job.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:84%
JEREMY SINGER: In
essence, though,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:84%
this course is about more
than just the intricacies

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Haskell
programming language.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
We really want you
to become familiar

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.930 align:middle line:84%
with the underlying concepts
of functional programming.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:90%
That's a much broader aim.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.950 align:middle line:84%
You see, functional
concepts are popping up

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:84%
in all kinds of modern general
purpose programming languages.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.002 align:middle line:84%
Think about lambdas in C++
and Java, for instance.

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:84%
WIM VANDERBAUWHEDE:
Before we leave

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.209 align:middle line:84%
you to learn some
Haskell, we would

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
like to introduce you to the
man after whom the Haskell

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:90%
language was named.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Haskell Curry was a prominent
logician in the 20th century,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and the Haskell committee
got the approval

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:84%
of his widow to
use his first name

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:90%
for their great new language.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I guess that just gives you
an idea how deeply Haskell

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.326 align:middle line:90%
is rooted in formal logic.

00:01:52.326 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:90%
JEREMY SINGER: Right.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:90%
That's enough talking.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's get coding.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
We've really enjoyed putting
this course together,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and we hope you're
going to enjoy it too.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:84%
This week there are lots
of interactive web-based

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:84%
programming exercises for you
to get a grounding in the syntax

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:90%
and basic concepts of Haskell.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Do try them out, and let us know
how you get on in the comments

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:90%
section below.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Happy coding!

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:27.192 align:middle line:90%
