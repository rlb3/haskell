00:00:08.765 --> 00:00:15.720 align:middle line:84%
JEREMY: Algorithms plus data
structures equals programs.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.610 align:middle line:84%
This famous equation
was introduced

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:90%
by Niklaus Wirth in the 1970s.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:84%
In terms of Haskell
programming, you now

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:84%
know enough about algorithms
and data structures

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
in order to create
meaningful Haskell programs.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:84%
As far as algorithms
go, you have

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
looked at recursion and also
at mapping simple functions

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:90%
over lists of data elements.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of data
structures, we've

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
spent lots of time
exploring lists.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And this week we also introduced
the tree data structure

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:84%
as well as giving
you the apparatus

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to define your own custom
algebraic data types.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Next week we are going to think
about cannibal programs that

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
eat other programs
as their input data.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:90%
These are called parsers.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:84%
We're now halfway through the
functional programming course.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:90%
You're doing really well.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:90%
We've got three weeks left.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Please leave your comments
in the section below,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and I look forward to
seeing you again next week.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Bye

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.755 align:middle line:90%
