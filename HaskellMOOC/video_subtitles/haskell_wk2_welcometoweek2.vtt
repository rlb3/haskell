JEREMY: Hi!

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.470 align:middle line:84%
We hope you enjoyed the
first week of our functional

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:90%
programming course.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.550 align:middle line:84%
This week, we're going to be
looking at more basic building

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:90%
blocks of the Haskell language.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:84%
We'll explore programs
that have side effects.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:84%
This is moderately complex in
a pure language like Haskell.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:84%
We'll also be telling you
how to install the GHC tool

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:84%
chain on your local
machine so you won't

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:84%
need to be logged into our
online Haskell interpreter

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:84%
in order to run your
Haskell programs.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Let me leave you with a
funny joke about Haskell

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:90%
from the XKCD webcomic.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:84%
One person says, "Code
written in Haskell

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
is guaranteed to have
no side effects."

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And the other person
quizzically replies,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:84%
"Because no one
will ever run it?"

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:84%
We hope that you'll all be
running lots of Haskell code

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.270 align:middle line:84%
this week on the functional
programming course.
