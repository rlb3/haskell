WIM VANDERBAUWHEDE: Hi,
and welcome to week five

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.700 align:middle line:90%
of the Haskell course.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.850 align:middle line:84%
As Larry Wall once said,
one of the main virtues

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.475 align:middle line:90%
of the programmer is laziness.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Laziness is also a key
feature of Haskell.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And this week, you will learn
what laziness and strictness

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.060 align:middle line:90%
really mean.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So far, we have used
types in our programs

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:84%
but we have actually
glossed over the details.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And in Haskell, types are
a really essential part

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.230 align:middle line:84%
of the language and the type
system is very powerful.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:84%
This week, you will learn about
function types, type variables,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:90%
and type classes.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.916 align:middle line:84%
We will also show
you Haskell can

00:00:45.916 --> 00:00:48.501 align:middle line:84%
infer the types of
expressions in a program

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't have to
provide the type information

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:90%
for every single expression.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy and see you next week.
