00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.960 align:middle line:84%
JEREMY: Simon, you've
got a big pile of books there.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Haskell textbooks,
to be precise.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to give
us some recommendations?

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.770 align:middle line:84%
SIMON: Yeah I've got four
here I was going to recommend.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.400 align:middle line:90%
First is 'Real World Haskell'.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.420 align:middle line:90%
This was long-awaitedd.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.015 align:middle line:90%
Actually it's been out a while.

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:90%
It's been out nearly 10 years.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I guess they're probably about
to do the second edition.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Came out in 2008.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's a brief
introduction, somewhat,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:84%
but they inquire a lot about
using Haskell in practice

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:84%
so I think this is the one
that the developers will often

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.929 align:middle line:90%
pick up.

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:84%
It's for experienced
programmers.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:84%
In a similar way, but it
says A Beginner's Guide

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:90%
is 'Learn You a Haskell'.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:84%
An advantage of this is that
it's available free, online.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And because it's more recent,
will talk about, in detail,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
about things like
monads, monoids.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I suppose all the books
talk about monads,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:84%
but this goes into more
detail about some of the more

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.250 align:middle line:90%
mathematical end of things.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Graham Hutton's book--
one of the advantages

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:90%
is that this is nice and thin.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So you'll get it
in 160 odd pages.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I know Graham's writing
another edition of this.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So by the time-- this should be
out early 2017, I would guess.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's about 10 years
after this came out.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:90%
But a good basic introduction.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:90%
And I'll conclude with mine.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.165 align:middle line:90%
JEREMY: [LAUGHS]

00:01:30.165 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:84%
SIMON: Let's have a
shameless plug just for mine.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.219 align:middle line:84%
I wrote the first edition
of this around the late 90s.

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
JEREMY: What's
your book called?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:84%
SIMON: It's called
'Haskell: The Craft

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.853 align:middle line:90%
of Functional Programming'.

00:01:38.853 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:90%
This edition is from 2011.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I guess I will start thinking
about doing another edition.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:90%
It's grown.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle line:90%
It's quite thick.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I might try and
take some material

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:90%
out of the new edition.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think covers things
in quite a lot of depth,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
quite a lot of examples that
you can work through in there.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.636 align:middle line:84%
But all of them have a
different take so buy them all.

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:90%
JEREMY: [LAUGHS] Thanks.
