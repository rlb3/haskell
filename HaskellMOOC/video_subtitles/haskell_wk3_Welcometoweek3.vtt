JEREMY: Hi, and welcome back
to week three of the Functional

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Programming in Haskell course.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.780 align:middle line:84%
This week, we'll be
exploring the list data

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.410 align:middle line:90%
structure in even more detail.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Then, we'll move on to defining
custom data structures.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.100 align:middle line:84%
This is an important part of
any high-level programming

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we'll dig into
the history of Haskell.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Why does it look like it does?

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:84%
We'll be asking one of the
main architects of the Haskell

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
language to answer some
of these questions for us.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Hope you enjoy the week.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:90%
See you later.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.659 align:middle line:90%
