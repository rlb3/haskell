00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.595 align:middle line:90%
DR. JEREMY SINGER: Wow!

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:10.606 align:middle line:90%
We're at the end of the course.

00:00:10.606 --> 00:00:12.350 align:middle line:90%
Ohh.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.960 align:middle line:90%
But know we're really happy.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Now we are functional
programmers.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.460 align:middle line:84%
DR. WIM VANDERBAUWHEDE: Over
the past six weeks,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.290 align:middle line:84%
we have been on a
learning journey,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.870 align:middle line:84%
discovering the Haskell
language and the key concepts

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:90%
of functional programming.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and I hope that your
journey doesn't stop here,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.938 align:middle line:84%
that you will carry on with
functional programming.

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:84%
DR. JEREMY SINGER: If you
want to keep up with Haskell,

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:84%
there are plenty of
resources online.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Check out some of
the links below.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:84%
The best place to
start is probably

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.270 align:middle line:90%
the haskell.org website.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.055 align:middle line:84%
We also recommend you sign up
for the Haskell mailing list.

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:45.430 align:middle line:84%
DR. WIM VANDERBAUWHEDE: However,
the main learning objective

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.862 align:middle line:84%
for this course is to enable
you to think functionally.

00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Now that you have this
functional perspective,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:84%
it will change the
way you develop code.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So you might be using list
comprehensions in Python,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.605 align:middle line:84%
lambdas in C++, or
maps and folds in Java.

00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:00.980 align:middle line:84%
DR. JEREMY SINGER:
We hope you've

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:90%
enjoyed taking the course.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.778 align:middle line:84%
We've certainly
enjoyed the experience.

00:01:04.778 --> 00:01:08.445 align:middle line:90%
So a final word of valediction.

00:01:08.445 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:84%
DR. WIM VANDERBAUWHEDE: May your
functions always type-check.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
DR. JEREMY SINGER: May
your stack never overflow.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
DR. WIM VANDERBAUWHEDE: And may your
programs always terminate.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.993 align:middle line:90%
