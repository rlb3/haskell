Hey!

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.140 align:middle line:84%
We're at the end of the
first week of our functional

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.510 align:middle line:90%
programming course.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.080 align:middle line:90%
I hope you've enjoyed yourself.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:84%
This week, we've looked at
basic expressions and functions.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:84%
We've studied a model of
evaluation called reduction.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And we've also introduced
the list data type.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:84%
If you're a Haskell
novice, please tell us

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:84%
what you found to
be particularly

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:84%
interesting or challenging this
week in the comments section

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:90%
below.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Hope to see you back
again next week.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Bye!
