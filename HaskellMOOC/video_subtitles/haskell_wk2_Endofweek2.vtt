JEREMY: Here we are
at the end of Week 2

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.310 align:middle line:84%
of the functional
programming course.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.250 align:middle line:84%
This week, we thought about
some more building blocks

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.430 align:middle line:90%
in the Haskell language.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.900 align:middle line:84%
We looked at things like if
statements and the Boolean data

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.970 align:middle line:90%
type.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:84%
We have also had
some more exploration

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.350 align:middle line:84%
of lists and how to manipulate
list data structures.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Then we moved on to considering
monads, particularly getting

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:84%
user input from the keyboard
and outputting characters

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:90%
to the terminal.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Next week, we're going to move
on to more advanced constructs

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:90%
in Haskell.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But for now, I want to leave
you with an implementation

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:90%
challenge.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you think of some more
guessing games-- like Guess

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
the Number or
Mastermind, if you're

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:90%
familiar with that board game?

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Post your ideas and links
to your implementations

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:90%
in the comments section below.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have fun
reading through those.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.376 align:middle line:84%
I hope you have
Haskell fun, too.

00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking forward
to seeing you again

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.300 align:middle line:84%
next week when we'll carry on
with our functional programming

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.900 align:middle line:90%
adventure.
