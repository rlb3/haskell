WIM: Hello, and welcome
to the sixth and final week

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.080 align:middle line:90%
of our Haskell Course.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.760 align:middle line:84%
You have come a long
way in these six weeks,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.820 align:middle line:84%
from the very basics of Haskell,
all the way to this week

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.590 align:middle line:84%
where we will discuss
some more advanced topics.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.450 align:middle line:90%
First, there's type classes.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.130 align:middle line:84%
In their 1990s article,
the designers of Haskell

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:84%
said that certainly the type
system is Haskell's most

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.270 align:middle line:90%
innovative feature.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And we think this is at least
in part due to the type classes.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
monads, the mystery

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:90%
at the heart of Haskell.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, what are they, and
what is their relationship

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:90%
to type classes?

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Also, there's the
lambda calculus,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:84%
the mathematical
formalism that underlies

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:90%
functional programming.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:84%
It was invented by Alonzo
Church in the 1930s

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:84%
to answer the question, what
does it mean to do computation.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:84%
All this and much more in
this final week of our course.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.128 align:middle line:90%
