Functional programming and Haskell in particular is used by a growing number of companies today, including some large multinationals. 

## Companies that use Haskell

There are lists of companies that use Haskell on [the Haskell web site](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_industry) and on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Where-is-Haskell-used-in-industry-today-2015). A few highlights are Facebook, IBM, Twitter, 
AT&T, Bank of America, Barclays Capital, NVIDIA and Microsoft.

Some interesting links are:

* Facebook uses Haskell in several projects, for example [Fighting spam with Haskell](https://code.facebook.com/posts/745068642270222/fighting-spam-with-haskell/).
* [Galois](https://galois.com/) has been an active Haskell user and promoter for over a decade. [This talk](https://www.scribd.com/document/45049621/Building-a-business-with-Haskell-Case-Studies-Cryptol-HaLVM-and-Copilot) introduces three case studies from some of their projects.
* The New York Times has a nice talk about [Haskell in the newsroom](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/haskell-newsroom-nyt).
* [Running a Startup on Haskell](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Running-a-Startup-on-Haskell).


## Companies that use functional programming languages other than Haskell

* Twitter uses [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), an FP with Java syntax running on the JVM. [How and why Twitter uses Scala](https://www.redfin.com/blog/2010/05/how_and_why_twitter_uses_scala.html).
* Walmart uses [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), a dialect of the Lisp programming language. [Walmart runs Clojure at scale](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2015/6/30/walmart-runs-clojure-at-scale).
* Bloomberg uses [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), and object-oriented version of the ML programming language. [OCaml at Bloomberg](http://cufp.org/2014/maxime-ransan-adopting-functional-programming-with-ocaml-at-bloomberg-lp.html).
* SocialText uses [LiveScript](http://livescript.net/), a functional language with many similarities to Haskell, which compiles to JavaScript. [Read about their experiences](http://www.aosabook.org/en/posa/from-socialcalc-to-ethercalc.html).
