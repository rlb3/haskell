We are looking forward to welcoming you to 
[Functional Programming in Haskell](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-haskell/1/) 
next week. The course will take place online and 
will consist of a variety of videos, articles, 
interactive programming tasks and discussions.

We will introduce Haskell by comparing its features
with other programming languages that you might have seen before,
like Python, Java or Ruby.

Over the six weeks of the course, we will explore a wide
range of concepts and constructs so you should be able to read and
write meaningful Haskell programs. Our key advice is: *don't try
to absorb all the information passively* --- the best way to start
learning a programming language is to write your own code.

The programming tasks during the first two weeks will use a 
browser-based environment. After this, we will move to the 
[Haskell platform](https://www.haskell.org/downloads) on your
own machine --- ideally a desktop or laptop running Windows, Linux
or macOS. You might want to check that you have access to a
machine on which you can install Haskell tools.

See you next week, when the course begins.
Best wishes,
