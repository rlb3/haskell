We've reached the end of the course. However the learning materials will remain online so you can catch up or review content later on.

Lots of learners have given us helpful feedback about the course. Some people wanted us to provide *coding challenges* for you. Here are two possible exercises that you might attempt:

1. a [noughts-and-crosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game, perhaps with a web front end using [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/)
2. an ASCII-art based  maze generator, using one of the standard [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)

From all the team at Glasgow, thanks for participating in the course. It's been a great experience and we hope you will have the confidence to use Haskell and functional programming techniques in future software development projects.

Keep on coding!
