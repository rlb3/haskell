Examples of good FutureLearn flagship videos:

https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/electrify [wacky]
https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/real-world-calculus  [applications, action]
https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/data-to-insight [slow, boring, professional]
https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/begin-programming [very personal, bit geeky]


ideas for flagship video

- why are there so many programming languages?

[ scrolling list of languages, or shot of programming languages timeline
poster from http://www.levenez.com/lang/ ] 
Mention some stats - hundreds of languages ... 


- what is functional programming?

[shots of computer processors, of lambda calculus, of category theory]
[ talk about lang paradigms, hardware developments, mathematical formalisms
underlying FP ]

- history of Haskell

[shots of Glasgow University] 
[shots of People]
Mention that Haskell was born at Glasgow, developed here over 20 years. Now used across all sectors of CS (examples from the Haskell Report?)

- why should you learn Haskell?

[shots of us teaching Haskell to UG classes ]
motivation.
