We have been overwhelmed by the positive response to
Functional Programming in Haskell. You are now part of a community
of over 5000 learners. The immediate sense of togetherness
is apparent from the comments and discussion forums. It's great
to see everyone helping each other out with advice and feedback.

We realise there have been several glitches with the 
interactive tutorial exercises, for which we apologise.
We pushed an update last Wednesday afternoon, so hopefully things 
should be more stable now. Sometimes, the `next` and 
`prev` commands don't work --- this is due to error handling
with unexpected input. It might be best to use the `stepN` command,
where `N` is the step you want to move to.

Later this week, we will be advising you to install Haskell
software on your own computer. We recommend either the 
[Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) or
[Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).
Our team of mentors, including
[Blair](https://www.futurelearn.com/profiles/4396391),
[Cristian](https://www.futurelearn.com/profiles/4188971) and 
[Magnus](https://www.futurelearn.com/profiles/4396698),
will be on hand to guide you through
the installation process if you have difficulties.

As you continue to engage with the course throughout this week,
we look forward to reading your comments and responding to
feedback regularly. Happy Haskell-ing!

Best wishes,
