Many of you have spent the past fortnight getting to know Haskell.
However it's apparent that some learners have considerable prior
expertise in functional programming.
One of the most encouraging aspects of our community
interaction has been the way that experienced learners have
helped and supported the novice Haskell-ers.
This is excellent --- you are doing so well that the
course educators almost feel redundant!

By now, you should have installed Haskell software on your own machine.
However if you have problems with your installation,
please post your issues in the comments and we will try to assist you.
At the very least, you need to be able to run GHCi to participate in
the programming exercises for the remainder of the course.

We had great fun reading your source code submissions for
guessing games --- including Guess the Number and Mastermind.
I'm coding up a Battleships game, which I'll push to github soon.

Later this week,
[Blair](https://www.futurelearn.com/profiles/4396391) and I
will post a
[feedback video](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-haskell/1/steps/122939)
online.
We will be responding to your comments and trying to identify
high-level themes that emerge from learner activities.

Keep on coding!
