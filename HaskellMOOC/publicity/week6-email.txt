In this final week of the course, we will encounter some of the
more advanced topics that underpin functional programming.
We will see how *type classes* enable ad-hoc polymorphism in 
Haskell. We will go back to the 1930s and discover *lambda 
calculus* --- the theoretical basis of functional programming.

Finally, we will stop mumbling about *monads* and explain how
they work. 

Thanks for keeping up with the course. Do continue to post comments
and feedback this week. As always, the teaching team will available to help.
Enjoy week 6 and thank you for your participation throughout the course.

Keep on coding!
