Now that you have some confidence with Haskell,
we will move into more challenging territory. This week 
we will explore text parsers and the QuickCheck tool.
These tasks will require the use of two Haskell libraries --- 
one of the strengths of the language is the vast array of
freely available tools and code.

Our team of course mentors will be on hand to help out if you have any difficulties with these activities. 

Last Friday, I (Jeremy) visited the 
[Haskell eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7276-haskell-exchange-2016) event in London,
where I met several learners on our course. It was great
to see you in person and to chat about your experiences.

Keep on coding!
