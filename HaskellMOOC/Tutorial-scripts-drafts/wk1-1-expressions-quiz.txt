Quiz for Lecture on Expressions and Equations 

8 Questions, multiple choice. 

1. What is the difference between an expression and a statement in an imperative programming language

1.a (correct)

* Expressions denote small scale computations that return a value
* Statements handle sequencing, looping, conditionals, and all the large scale operation of a program

1.b

Expressions determine control flow and are often composed of statements

2. What is the result of the following expression in Haskell, where sqrt returns the square root of its argument:  `sqrt 16+9`

2.a 

5

2.b (correct)

13


3. What is the result of the following expression in Haskell, where sqrt returns the square root of its argument: 

  sqrt (16+9)

2.a (correct)

5

2.b

13

4. Give one reason why the following code is incorrect in Haskell:

  x = 4
  x = ((x * 2))

4.a 
Because there are too many parenteses

4.b (correct)
Because you can assign an expression to a name only once

5. What is the term for variables that can be assigned to an expression only once?

5.a (correct) 

immutable variables

5.b 

constant variables

6. What is the result of the expression `abs -6` in Haskell, where abs returns the absolute value of its argument.

6.a 

6

6.b (correct)

An error because Haskell interprets this code as `abs - 6` and abs  requires a numerical argument.

7. In Haskell, what is the name for the type of expression

  n = n + 1

7.a (correct)

equation

7.b

assignment

8. Is it valid to write `n = n + 1` in Haskell

8.a (correct)
Yes, but Haskell will fail to compute the result

8.b
No, it is a syntax error
